# algebracode

Algebra library. Comments and use guidelines of this library can be read in algebracode.com.

Here you will mainly find functional scala programs applied to algebra. My goal is to learn and develop step by step a useful package for algebra including:

Groups
Rings
Fields
Finite fields
Quaternion algebras
Polynomial rings
Number theory
Group Rings

I would be thankful for any recommendations and comments that could help to improve the code & math.

Comments and improvement proposals are welcome.
